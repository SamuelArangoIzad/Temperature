# Temperature

**Description:**
Temperature is a tool designed to quickly get the average, maximum, minimum, average above maximum, and average below minimum temperature for a specific area. This allows the user to record temperatures directly.

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** Temperature is developed in C++ to ensure efficiency and performance in console environments.
- **Libraries used:**
  - '#include<iostream>'
  - '#include<string>'
  - '#include<sstream>'
  - '#include<vector>'
  - '#include<algorithm>'
  - '#include<limits>'

## Development Approach

**1. Temperature Collection and Recording:**
   - Allows the user to directly enter the temperatures for the specific area.

**2. Temperature Calculations:**
   - Performs automatic calculations to get the average, maximum, minimum, average above maximum, and average below minimum temperature.

**3. Console Interface:**
   - Use the console to display temperature results in a clear and organized manner.
